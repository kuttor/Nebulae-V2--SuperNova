# Nebulae-V2--SuperNova

 Huge rewrite and direction. 

 So I am using TheTechnoBears v2.2.2 as my base firmware -- don't know if that matters. 

 Features::

 1. One-Shot Mode: Replace grain trigger mode switched to by using "source+freeze" with reset input as the trigger input. 
 2. Turn-Table Mode: Initialized with subsequent "source+freeze" button combo, uses one-shot however frees up "Speed" encoder as a CDJ-like platter.
 3. Buckethead KillSwitch: Replaced freeze with a momentary mute button that sits end-of-chain. Triggerable with "freeze input"
 4. Filters: Window is repurposed as a filter cutoff, with "source+window" as resonance. 5 filter types switchable via "source+reset"
   a. low-pass
   b. high-pass
   c. bitcrusher filter
   d. forment
   e. comb
 5. Effect dry/wet: Repurposed source+overlap to be dry/wet for the 2 effect switchet
 6. Effect switcher: "source+size" repurposed as a 2-way effect switcher. Noon is no effects. CCW is reverb and CW is a pitch-shifter chord mode
 7. Strum: "source+start" changes grain pattern for the granular engine.
 8. grain harmonizer: replaces "source+pitch" random pitch introduction with predictable fifths, octaves, 3rds...
 9. Scales: replaces "source+density" with a scale switcher... change chromatic, major, minors, etc.
