# Nebulae-V2--SuperNova
This is a modified version of TheTechnoBears a_graulerlooper.instr that is focused on performability and Mangling. It sets an absolute start and end of the sample/buffer, Morphegene's gap between loop capability, and further development will remove secondary controls for random grains and replace them with expected outcomes, adds chords like Miso Cornflake and Granulita Versio, reverb and other effects set either for just the grains or end-of-chain, beat chopping, beat slicing, and a Buckethead style performative killswitch.
