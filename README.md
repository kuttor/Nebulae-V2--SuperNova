# Nebulae-V2--SuperNova
This is a modified version of TheTechnoBears a_graulerlooper.instr that is focused on performability and Mangling. It sets an absolute start and end of the sample/buffer, morphegen gap between loop capability, and further development will remove secondary controls for random grains, etc for expected outcomes, effects, beat chopping and slicing.
